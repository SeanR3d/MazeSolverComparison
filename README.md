Description: This program uses Threads to run two animated maze solving algorithms simultaneously
  to compare solve time between depth-first search and breadth-first search. The mazes can also
  be generated using depth-first search (genDFSMaze()).
 
NOTE:
Built upon a homework assignment where we had to implement solveMaze()
  using a depth-first search algorithm. For extra credit, we could implement genDFSMaze()
  to generate a maze using a depth-first search algorithm as well. The threading and animation was done
  out of curiosity.
Code marked "provided by professor" was written by Dr. Andrew Rosen (Temple University)
  for the original assignment.
